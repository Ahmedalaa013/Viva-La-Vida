        <h2 class="postTitle">How to Cook a Steak Accurately</h2>
        <p class="postText">
          When we refer to a steak, we are implying that the cut of beef we are
          cooking is a cut that is tender enough to be eaten with fork and
          knife. You can cook pretty much any cut of beef in the method I am
          going to outline. However, cuts from the chuck or shoulder of the cow
          are going to have a lot of sinew and be very chewy, which is why they
          are best for slow moist heat cooking such as braising. The steaks I am
          highlighting here have a good amount of flavor and can be cooked to
          tender in a short amount of time without marinating or other
          tenderizing techniques. These are also steak cuts that can be cooked
          to temperature, meaning the steak can be served at rare or well-done
          temperatures and still be juicy, tender and flavorful.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          When we cook a knife tender cut of steak, we cook the steak over
          direct heat. What that means is the steak is directly hitting the
          cooking surface, as in the case of grilling or pan sautéing. The
          simplest way to create consistent and predictable results in cooking
          your steak is to be meticulous about the heat of the surface. I
          suggest a temperature of 425 for stove top and 450 for the grill. I
          use a lower temperature inside because the pan and burner give a more
          controlled and consistent heat source than a grill. The grill's heat
          source has to contend with opening and closing the lid and wind which
          fluctuate and can drop the temperature.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          Season your steaks generously with salt and pepper at least 30 minutes
          before cooking. The fattier the cut the more salt I use, because salt
          balances the richness of the fat (think French fries). This draws the
          seasoning inside of the meat and will provide more flavor.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          Home cooks have a distinct advantage over restaurants in cooking
          steaks. At home, we have a controlled environment in which we can
          bring our meat closer to room temperature before we cook it. In
          restaurants, it would be to easy for mistakes to happen and safety and
          sanitation to become an issue. At home, you can safely let your meat
          rest at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to cooking. When you
          warm your steak somewhat, the meat will cook more evenly. A properly
          cooked steak is the same temperature from edge to edge, a rare steak
          should be brown on the edge and red in the middle.

          To tell when the steak (or any meat) is done, all you need is an
          instant read thermometer. I would suggest investing in one with a very
          fine tip and rapid read if you can swing the hefty price tag. Even if
          you just use a regular instant read thermometer, it will give you 100%
          accurate results.

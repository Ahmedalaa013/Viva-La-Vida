        <h2 class="postTitle">Vegan Asparagus Salad</h2>
        <p class="postText">
          I have to admit that I've never eaten this salad before and haven't
          even heard of it. So the first thing I did was doing some research to
          find out what goes into it at all. I found the following: the salad
          originated in France and is also called a Nice Salad, although the
          first written-down recipe isn't even from Nice, but from Paris.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          There has probably never been a standard recipe, but a few components
          apparently can't be missing: tomatoes, olives, anchovies, tuna,
          potatoes, eggs, and onions. However, since anchovies, tuna, and eggs
          definitely don't end up on our shopping list, we simply substituted
          them.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          Our vegan egg alternative: For the eggs, I didn't have to think twice
          as we already have a great recipe for vegan eggs on the blog. Be sure
          to check the miso paste to make sure it's vegan. Also, there are light
          and dark miso pastes – both would work, but to recreate the color of
          an egg white, the light miso paste is better.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          To get a perfect egg shape in the end, we used round silicone ice cube
          molds. A little tip for those who don't have one: there are small
          compartments for the eggs in almost all refrigerators. If these can be
          easily removed from yours, they are the perfect silicone mold
          replacement! The eggs can also be easily prepared the day before and
          stored overnight in the fridge.
        </p>

          All the other ingredients: In addition to the eggs, we left out the
          anchovies and tuna. There isn't a 1:1 substitute for them in this
          recipe – and there is actually no need for it. Instead, just choose
          any alternative (seasonal) salad ingredients of your desire. I opted
          for lentils, radishes, and strawberries. You can prepare the asparagus
          in different ways: either boil it in water or bake it in the oven. For
          the latter, you need to drizzle the asparagus with olive oil, and
          season it with salt and pepper. Strawberries and asparagus can be
          easily substituted depending on the season, e.g. with princess beans
          and red peppers.

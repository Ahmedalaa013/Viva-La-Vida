        <h2 class="postTitle">How to Prevent Soggy Veggie Pizza</h2>
        <p class="postText">
          Veggie pizzas have grown in popularity as more and more consumers jump
          on the healthy-eating bandwagon, but making these pies palatable can
          be a real challenge for pizza operations. That’s because the
          significant water content in all those veggies — everything from
          artichokes to zucchini — works against efforts to bring a crispy,
          crunchy, pizza to the table.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          It’s important for any heavily veggie-topped pizza to be cooked at a
          slightly higher temperature. This helps “seal” the crust before it has
          a chance to absorb too much moisture, Not all crusts can take the heat
          often associated with brick ovens or pizza stones, however. Alive &
          Kickin’s Classic Neapolitan Dough Balls, for example, are made from
          imported Italian flour and work great with high-heat oven applications
          of 600° F and up. Be sure to experiment to find the right temperature,
          as all ovens vary.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          Instead of slicing the mozzarella and immediately placing the cheese
          on the crust, set the slices on a paper towel to absorb excess
          moisture for at least 15 minutes, flipping once to make sure both
          sides “drain.” You could also place it in a colander and allow liquid
          to drain prior to blotting it with towels. Regular mozzarella has very
          little water content, comparatively, and doesn’t require this step.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          It’s tempting to mound on the toppings, but when it comes to veggie
          pizza recipes, less is best. Measuring your ingredients every time,
          including toppings and pizza sauce, will help determine just the right
          quantities that give you the results you want. If you make your own
          pizza dough from scratch, it can vary widely from one batch to the
          next depending on humidity, ingredients and more. Using a par-baked
          pizza crust or pre-made dough ball ensures consistent performance,
          quality and cost every time.

          Common vegetables used on veggie pizzas like bell peppers, broccoli,
          onions, mushrooms, black olives and spinach are often considered the
          most flavorful combinations, but they’re also ranked among those with
          the highest moisture content. Consider grilling, roasting or sautéing
          vegetables before putting them on the crust; this not only adds
          another element of flavor to the toppings, but releases much of the
          moisture.

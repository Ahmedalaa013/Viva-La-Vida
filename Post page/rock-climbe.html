        <p class="postText">
          New Zealand is a veritable treasure trove when it comes to climbing,
          making it a favourite destination for mountaineers and cragspeople
          alike. However, with so many mountains, crags, and rockfaces to choose
          from it can sometimes be a challenge to pinpoint the very best
          climbing spots in New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          The mountainous South Island and the hilly North Island offer a range
          of different challenges to climbers of all levels. The geological
          variety found in this volcanically active land provides a unique
          experience that visitors relish and make New Zealand something of a
          climbing Mecca.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          Perhaps the greatest mountain climbing challenge the country and
          indeed the whole continent of Australasia has to offer is that of
          Mount Cook (Aoraki). This snow-topped peak of 3,724m is the mountain
          the local hero Sir Edmund Hillary famously climbed in preparation for
          his ascent of Everest in 1953. Naturally, it is an absolute favourite
          destination for aspiring and upcoming mountain climbers the world
          over.

          Once you’re all set to travel, you’ll just need to pick the perfect
          spots for your climbing adventure. The following guide will give you a
          quick introduction to some of the places you’ll find the best peaks
          and crags that any enthusiast can enjoy on both islands.

          Close to the popular tourist towns of Queenstown and Wanaka, are a
          wide variety of popular mountaineering excursions. Mount Aspiring
          (Tititea) is the most challenging of these at a height of 3,033.
          However, those seeking a slightly more forgiving experience still have
          plenty of options available nearby like the aptly named Remarkables
          mountain range, or Roy’s Peak which offers spectacular views of Lake
          Wanaka.

          I'm a Canadian solo traveler with a knack for misadventure. Let me
          tell you my friend, travel (especially travelling somewhere that is
          very different from home), can be overwhelming. I totally get
          it...it's always scary to step outside your comfort zone, but I can
          assure you that it is so worth it. Travel will change you and the way
          you view the world.

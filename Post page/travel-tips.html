          We love to travel. But the ugly truth is that the tourism industry has
          fostered some unsustainable habits. From cities overrun by mass
          tourism to substantial environmental problems, our wanderlust has a
          serious impact. Air and water pollution, displacement of local
          populations, unfair distribution of wealth, and gentrification. In our
          attempts to see the world, we sometimes do more harm than good.

          Travel isn’t always about distance; it’s about opening yourself up for
          new experiences. You don’t have to go far to get out of your comfort
          zone. There are probably lots of new and exciting things to do close
          to home. Instead of spending lots of money and flying halfway around
          the world, you can also have fun by travelling locally.
        </p>

          If you don’t want to contribute to the negative impact of
          over-tourism, you’re best off avoiding the famous bucket-list
          destinations. Many places are popular for a reason but suffer from
          mass tourism.

          There are plenty of beautiful places on this earth, so focus on the
          hidden gems rather than the big hitters. You’ll be able to enjoy your
          vacation without huge crowds, get a more authentic cultural
          experience, and have a much more original trip. Plus you’ll also help
          these smaller communities by providing them with income from your
          visit. Do you want to do what everyone else is doing?

          Picking sustainable modes of transport doesn’t end when you reach your
          destination. So, instead of renting a car, consider taking public
          transportation. Even outside of cities, there may be local buses or
          shuttle buses to get around. Driving does work out as a sustainable
          option when you’re sharing the ride with as many people as possible,
          especially in an electric car. Road trip anyone?

          I'm a Canadian solo traveler with a knack for misadventure. Let me
          tell you my friend, travel (especially travelling somewhere that is
          very different from home), can be overwhelming. I totally get
          it...it's always scary to step outside your comfort zone, but I can
          assure you that it is so worth it. Travel will change you and the way
          you view the world.

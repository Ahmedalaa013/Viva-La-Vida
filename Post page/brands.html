          The Spanish Fashion Brands Every Man Should Know
        </h2>
        <p class="postText">
          Spain: a land rich with culinary delights, culture, sun-drenched
          beaches and, perhaps less famously, some of the finest menswear brands
          around. Neighbouring France and Italy tend to hog the limelight when
          it comes to fashion, but Spain shouldn’t be overlooked. We all know
          about Zara and its fast-fashion empire, but there’s so much more to
          this vibrant Meditteranean country than just catwalk copycatting.
        </p>

        <p class="postText">
          <b>Loewe</b> Pronounced ‘lo-weh-vay’, this Spanish fashion titan is
          luxury conglomerate LVMH’s oldest brand at 175 years. It originally
          specialised in leather goods, like purses and handbags, and was even
          granted a Royal Warrant in 1905. <br />
          After launching its first ready-to-wear collection in 1965, Loewe
          became a fully fledged fashion brand in its own right and, thanks to
          the appointment of renegade British designer Jonathan Anderson as
          creative director, is now a common sight on the shoulders of A-list
          celebs and rap royalty.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          <b>Comovita</b> Brands love to talk about being “sustainable”, but
          scratch a little bit below the surface and most are doing the bare
          minimum at best. Not Comovita. As far as we can tell, this Spanish
          brand practises what it preaches. <br />
          The secret lies in Comovita’s business model. Instead of producing
          clothes in bulk, with many going to landfill when they don’t sell, the
          brand makes clothes to order, meaning no wasteage. The quality is high
          too, so this is clothing that will stand the test of time, and designs
          cover all the key wardrobe essentials, from T-shirts and jeans to
          sneakers.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          <b>Massimo Dutti</b> You’ve probably come across Massimo Dutti before
          and assumed it was the work of an Italian designer of the same name.
          But you’d be wrong. In fact, Massimo Dutti is simply the trademark
          used by this Spanish clothing label, which makes simple, stylish
          clothing at affordable prices. <br />
          Are these clothes cutting-edge, super-premium or handwoven by local
          craftspeople? No, but they’re perfect if you’re looking for basic,
          good-looking seasonal staples that won’t leave you out of pocket.

          <b>Zara</b> Love it or hate it, if you’re after the latest men’s
          fashion trends at high-street prices, Zara is the place to go. The
          brand is renowned for stealing the season’s hottest looks off the
          runway and getting them onto shelves quicker than anywhere else.
          <br />
          ‘Stealing’ being the operative word – there have been numerous cases
          of labels taking Zara to court for allegedly copying their designs.
          Amiri, Christian Louboutin and Rains to name a few. Still, it is
          undeniably the biggest name in fast fashion, and there are plenty of
          trend-led bargains to be found if you can look past the nastiness.

        <p class="postText">
          It doesn't matter if you're a beginning programmer, still in high
          school, or well into your career in development. Now is a great time
          to get into competitive programming. But just what is it, and how do
          you get started? Read on to find out.
        </p>

        <p class="postText">
          Competitive programming involves programmers competing against each
          other to solve programming questions in a limited amount of time.
          These events are usually held over the Internet or a local network.
          The contestants of the events are known as sport programmers.
          Contestants solve logical or mathematical programming questions in the
          coding language of their choice. The number of questions can vary
          depending on the contest. The results are judged on the number of
          questions solved, time spent solving the problems, and other factors,
          like execution time, program size, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          <b> Benefits of competitive programming</b> <br />
          There are many benefits to participating in programming contests,
          especially if programming is your career. Most competitive programming
          contests have prizes. These prizes can be in the form of cash,
          software, hardware, free services, and more. There have even been some
          sport programmers who had so much success competing in coding contests
          that they turned it into a career.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          Many tech companies, like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, use the same
          type of questions in their technical interviews as those you'll face
          in coding contests. While you may know how to write code, you may not
          be familiar with the algorithms and data structures that you must use
          to solve these types of problems. Competing in programming contests
          will give you the practice and confidence you need to make it through
          one of these intensive interviews.

          <b> Problem-solving and programming skills </b><br />
          There's probably no better way to improve your problem-solving and
          programming skills than by entering programming contests. During the
          contest, you'll be given complex problems that you'll have to solve in
          a limited time. Many of those problems are ones you may have never run
          into before. Solving them will improve your analytical thinking skills
          and teach you more about the programming language you chose to compete
          with. And these are skills you can take with you in your career.

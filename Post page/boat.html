          <b> You’ve been exploring Croatia. How was the sailing?</b> <br />
          Owner of Vijonara answers The Croatian coastline is blessed with more
          than 1,200 islands big and small, as well as two national parks,
          providing ample opportunities for very protected anchorages even when
          the wind blows at 25 knots. There are almost no depth restrictions,
          beautifully restored ancient cities and villages, great restaurants
          and very friendly people.
        </p>

        <p class="postText">
          <b> Did you make any discoveries when you were there?</b> <br />
          The cities of Dubrovnik, Tagir and Hvar are must-sees. As is the blue
          lagoon at the Island of Vis, a very similar but much less crowded an
          attraction compared to the one in Capri. The national park area around
          the Mljet islands is also incredibly beautiful. I strongly recommend a
          visit.

          <b> Did you see many other big boats in the areas you went?</b> <br />
          As sad as the Covid-19 situation is, the silver lining is that we had
          little or no competition for services and anchorages in the places we
          went. Plus, there were far fewer tourists. We basically had the places
          to ourselves, which was quite magical.

            You’re wrapping Komokwa’s hull in vinyl, instead of painting it…
          </b>
          <br />
          Yes! We’re doing it for a couple of reasons. Wrapping is a lot less
          expensive – $60,000 compared to $350,000 for a repaint. It also takes
          a lot less time, nine days versus four months, which means we won’t
          miss a season, and lastly wrapping is much more environmentally
          friendly. You can recycle the vinyl and there’s far fewer chemicals
          involved.

          <b> Were you nervous at all about it? </b><br />
          Very. My biggest concern was that the seams between the sheets of wrap
          would stand out. In fact you can’t see them from about five metres
          away. If you get closer, you can see them, but barely. The sheets are
          about 23 metres by 1.5 metres, so there are a number of seams, but it
          looks exactly like fresh paint. I’m really pleased with the result.

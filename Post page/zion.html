        <p class="postText">
          Zion National Park is one of the most popular National Parks in
          Southern Utah and for a good reason. Narrow slot canyons, red and
          white sandstone formations, 3,000-foot vertical walls, and the Virgin
          River make the main canyon of Zion National Park a spectacular place
          to explore.
        </p>

        <p class="postText">
          While Zion National Park can be visited year-round, temperatures are
          most pleasant in the months of April, May, early June, October, and
          November. Summertime is very hot and busy, but it is a nice time to
          hike in the Virgin River in the Zion Narrows. However, late July
          through September is considered flash flood season. If you are
          visiting Zion National Park during this time, pay close attention to
          the forecast and do not hike in any narrow canyons (including the
          Narrows hike) if rain is predicted. Winter can also be a great time to
          visit Zion National Park. Crowds are fewer and the top of the canyon
          looks especially beautiful with a light dusting of snow, although
          trail access is more limited in icy conditions. If you plan to visit
          Zion in the winter, be sure to check out our guide to cold weather
          layering.

          Zion National Park has two main regions. The main Zion Canyon, which
          should be on any first-timers itinerary and is the focus of this blog
          post, is most easily accessed via SR-9 which connects to the I-15 just
          north of St. George, Utah. The SR-9 runs directly into the Park’s
          South Entrance which is immediately past the small town of Springdale.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          The other region of Zion National Park is the Kolob Canyon area. This
          area is located in the northern end of the Park and is accessed
          directly from I-15 (Exit 40 near Cedar City, Utah). The Kolob region
          offers a little more solitude, big peaks, and the second-largest
          natural arch in the world. If you want to visit both parts of Zion,
          keep in mind that these two areas of the park are not connected by a
          direct road running through the park.

          <b> Zion National Park Camping </b><br />
          There are two drive-in campgrounds in the main Zion Canyon and they
          are less than 1/2 a mile from the Visitors Center at the entrance of
          the park. Sites are $20 for tent camping or $30 for a site with an
          electric hookup. All sites have picnic tables, a fire pit, and access
          to potable water, bathrooms, and trash containers. No showers are
          available at the campsites.

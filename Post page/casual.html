          Casual Style Tips for Guys Who Want to Look Sharp
        </h2>
        <p class="postText">
          Many men approach their casual style from the wrong angle; they aim to
          look youthful. But if you want to look well-dressed, you should always
          aim to look mature. Because maturity is an attractive quality in men.
          Maturity, after all, is what separates the men from the boys. Maturity
          shows masculinity and commands respect, and it’s a quality you want
          people to see in you. That doesn’t mean you have to dress like your
          dad. It doesn’t mean you have to dress old. It just means you have to
          avoid portraying yourself as a teenager… Unless you actually are a
          teenager.
        </p>

        <p class="postText">
          You want to dress like a grown up. Everything overly flashy like the
          items pictured here simply become inappropriate past certain age.
          Funny or cartoony tees are a definite no-go. Wearing a funny tee is
          basically like being the guy that makes the same joke over and over
          and over. It might be funny the first time you see the t-shirt, but t
          gets old fast. Also, avoid anything with slogans.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          The first thing you should do to shed your boyish look is giving up
          your graphic Tees. I know you love them. I once did too. In fact, I
          wore them non-stop. But you want to stop wearing them. You have so
          many better options. Despite popular belief, they don’t make you look
          funny, edgy or original. In fact, because every other guy is sporting
          a graphic tee too, you’ll just blend into the crowd. Plus, people
          associate them with guys who refuse to grow up. Just look at the
          movies. You’ll never see a tough, masculine action hero or a suave
          rom-com heartthrob wearing a a graphic tee. The only time you’ll see a
          graphic tee is when the character is either a man-child, an actual
          child, or a slacker.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          Avoid baggy jeans. You want to avoid having to pull up your jeans
          every two seconds. They should keep themselves up without a belt.
          Also, they should not pool around your ankles. Learn how jeans should
          fit properly. Also, avoid embellishments. That means: No excessive
          distress, no rips, and none of that bleaching nonsense. And finally —
          this should go without saying, but I have to say it anyway — Avoid big
          logos on your ass. In fact, no big logos anywhere on your outfit,
          PERIOD.

          Okay, you may want to sit down for this… Your dirty, beat-up sneakers
          will ruin an otherwise excellent outfit. You’ll want to replace them
          with something more dignified. And don’t think people don’t notice
          your shoes. They notice. Especially women. I can’t tell you how many
          compliments I get on my shoes from women, and I’m hardly shilling out
          hundreds of dollars for a single pair, as some guys recommend. It’s
          okay to wear a pair of clean white sneakers in a casual outfit. But if
          you want to class things up, wear a pair of brown leather shoes
          instead, and BOOM… You look sharper.

          How to Stand Out With Your Clothes Without Looking Try-Hard
        </h2>
        <p class="postText">
          A movie star is nothing without a supporting cast, a star football
          player is useless without a supporting team, and stand-out clothes are
          worthless without supporting clothes. You need both items to create a
          great outfit, but guys often fall into one of two categories Guys that
          wear too many stand-out clothes without any supporting pieces. Guys
          that only wear supporting pieces.
        </p>

        <p class="postText">
          The first type is trying too hard to stand out and the second type is
          trying too hard to blend in. Neither of which is desirable. You want
          your outfits to have a little pop, but you don’t want to overdo it.
          The way to do this is by finding the right balance between the clothes
          that catch attention and the ones that let them shine.
        </p>

          Statement pieces are the clothes that tempt you to buy them when you
          see them in the store. They’re eye-catchers. But too many men suffer
          from statement-overload. Many men who want to start dressing better
          start wearing too many statement pieces, which will make you look like
          a try-hard. You look like you’re begging for everyone’s attention, and
          it sends the wrong message. It also creates a look that’s too busy.
          There’s too much going on, and the eye can’t decide what part of your
          outfit to focus on.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          Supporting pieces are the cornerstone of your wardrobe. They are the
          items that make sure you always have something to wear with whatever
          you buy. They are the foundation on which you build your wardrobe. If
          your outfit is a masterpiece, then the supporting pieces are its
          canvas. It’s up to you to make it look amazing. Now, while too many
          statement pieces can make you look too busy and try-hard, you actually
          can create pretty good outfits with supporting pieces alone… You just
          run the risk of looking a bit dull.

          I can’t tell you exactly what the right balance is for you, because
          you’re just going to have to experiment with it a bit, but I can tell
          you that you will need more supporting pieces than statement pieces.
          Think: 3-4 supporting pieces for every statement piece. Although you
          can wear multiple statement pieces within the same outfit and look
          amazing, I suggest you style novices don’t get ahead of yourselves.

        <p class="postText">
          A Venetian gondola ride is a real bucket-list experience. And, as
          cliché as it sounds, no trip to Venice would be complete without a
          gondola ride. It’s like visiting New York and not going to the Statue
          of Liberty or going to Paris and not visiting the top of the Eiffel
          Tower… So even if you have just 1 day in Venice , a ride on a
          traditional Venetian gondola is one of the experiences that you really
          shouldn’t miss!
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          For centuries, black gondolas have been the unmistakable symbol of
          Venice. Even people who’ve never been to Italy would identify the city
          just by seeing a picture of a black gondola. Venetian gondolas and
          canals are among the most iconic and most recognizable images in the
          world.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          Even though all Venetian gondolas and gondoliers look pretty much the
          same and they all charge the same prices, your gondola ride will be
          unique depending on where you take a gondola.
        </p>
        <p class="postText">
          A friendly chap willing to talk to you and tell something about the
          sights along the way will make your ride so much more pleasant.
          Sometimes, gondoliers also take a picture of you in the gondola or
          sing a song along the way.

          If you are visiting Venice in spring or in summer, the best time to go
          on a gondola is in the morning before it becomes too hot. There is no
          shade on the gondolas, so you’ll be in full sun all the time. Our
          gondolier said that it gets so warm during the day that it’s just not
          pleasant. It might be different in the lower season, but in summer –
          try to avoid going on a gondola in the middle of the day.

          I'm a Canadian solo traveler with a knack for misadventure. Let me
          tell you my friend, travel (especially travelling somewhere that is
          very different from home), can be overwhelming. I totally get
          it...it's always scary to step outside your comfort zone, but I can
          assure you that it is so worth it. Travel will change you and the way
          you view the world.
